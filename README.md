# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing student performance data. The analysis includes exploring data trends, visualizing insights, and applying machine learning models for predictive tasks.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for creating visual representations of data trends.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn is employed for building predictive models and clustering analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Includes interactive notebooks (`analysis.ipynb`, `machine_learning.ipynb`) for detailed analysis workflows.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts (`visualization.py`, `scripts/`) for automating data visualization and analysis tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

  
## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**:
- Place your student performance dataset (`students.csv`) into the `data/` directory.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
- Open and run `analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset, perform statistical analysis, and generate initial insights.

3. **Visualization**:
- Execute `visualization.py` to generate visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize key metrics and trends in the data.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
- Explore `machine_learning.ipynb` for applying machine learning algorithms like regression, classification, or clustering to predict student performance or identify patterns.

5. **Scripts**:
- Customize scripts in the `scripts/` directory for specific data preprocessing, feature engineering, or other analysis tasks tailored to your dataset.

6. **Contributing**:
- Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Contributions to add new features or enhance existing functionalities are welcome.
